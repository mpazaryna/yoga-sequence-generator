# Yoga Tool for Teachers: Project Plan

## Introduction

The Yoga Tool for Teachers (YTT) is an application designed to assist yoga teachers in creating, analyzing, and customizing yoga sequences for their classes. By leveraging LLMs understanding of asana, this tool aims to streamline the class planning process and ensure sequences are well-suited for senior practitioners.

## Project Overview

This application will allow yoga teachers to generate sequences based on specific parameters such as class duration, difficulty level, and focus areas. It will provide text-based outputs detailing pose names, durations, and key instructions, making it easy for teachers to use and share their sequences.

## Core Features

1. LLM integration for asana data retrieval
2. Sequence generation algorithm
3. Customization options for senior practitioners
4. Text-based sequence output
5. Basic sequence analysis

## Milestones

### Basic Sequence Generation

Develop a simple algorithm to create yoga sequences based on basic parameters.

### Enhanced Sequence Customization

Improve sequence generation with options tailored for senior practitioners.

### Sequence Analysis and Refinement

Implement basic analysis tools to evaluate and improve generated sequences.

## Conclusion

This project plan outlines a structured approach to developing a valuable tool for senior yoga teachers. By following these milestones, we ensure a focused development process that delivers a functional application with room for future enhancements.
