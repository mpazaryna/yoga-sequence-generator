# Vinyasa Yoga Sequence - Hip Opening and Flexibility

By flowing through a series of postures that target the hips, hamstrings, and inner thighs, practitioners will have the opportunity to safely explore their range of motion and release tension in these areas. The sequence incorporates the use of props such as blocks and a strap to provide appropriate modifications and support.
