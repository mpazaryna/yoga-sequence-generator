## Talk Structure

### Opening and Setting Context (4:30)
- **Introduce the topic of mindfulness in relationships.**
  - Mindfulness is the practice of paying attention to the present moment with intention and without judgment.
  - It can help us to become more aware of our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and to respond to them in a more skillful way.
  - This can lead to more harmonious and fulfilling relationships.

### Main Teaching Points (27:00)
- **Developing presence.**
  - Mindfulness helps us to be more present in our relationships.
  - When we are present, we are able to pay attention to our partner without judgment and to respond to them in a more compassionate and understanding way.
  - Practice: Take a few moments to close your eyes and focus on your breath. Notice the sensation of your breath as it enters and leaves your body. Now, open your eyes and bring that same sense of presence to your interactions with your partner.
- **Emotional awareness.**
  - Mindfulness helps us to become more aware of our own emotions and the emotions of our partner.
  - When we are aware of our emotions, we are better able to regulate them and to respond to them in a skillful way.
  - Practice: Take a few moments to check in with your emotions. Notice what emotions are present and how they are affecting you. Now, try to identify the thoughts and behaviors that are contributing to those emotions.
- **Skillful communication.**
  - Mindfulness helps us to communicate more skillfully with our partner.
  - When we are mindful, we are able to listen to our partner without interrupting and to respond to them in a respectful and compassionate way.
  - Practice: Take a few moments to practice mindful listening. Find a partner and take turns speaking and listening. As you listen, focus on your partner's words and try to understand their perspective. When it is your turn to speak, be mindful of your words and how you are saying them.

### Practice or Meditation Guidance (9:00)
- **Mindful listening meditation.**
  - Sit facing your partner with your eyes closed.
  - Take a few deep breaths and allow yourself to relax.
  - Now, open your eyes and look at your partner.
  - Listen to your partner's words without interrupting or judging.
  - Simply be present and listen with your full attention.
  - After a few minutes, switch roles.
