# Yoga Sequence

## Class

This sequence is designed to gently warm up the body, build strength and balance through standing poses, release tension and promote flexibility with floor work, and finally, induce a deep state of relaxation and restoration through yoga nidra. The energy flow starts with a grounding and centering quality, gradually builds intensity, and then returns to a state of stillness and tranquility.
