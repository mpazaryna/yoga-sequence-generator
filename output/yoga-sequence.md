1. Opening: 
    - Centering and breath awareness: Start with Sukhasana (Easy Pose) or Seated Cross-Legged Pose. Sit erect and focus on your breath. Inhale and exhale deeply for 5-10 minutes. This will help you to center your mind and body. 
    - Gentle warm-up movements: Do some gentle neck rolls, shoulder rolls and hip circles to warm up your body. 
    - Setting intention: Close your eyes and set your intention for the practice. This could be a personal goal or a general positive affirmation.

2. Sun Salutations: 
    - Surya Namaskar A & B: Start with Sun Salutation A, slowly integrating breath with movement. Transition into Sun Salutation B, adding in Warrior poses for strength and alignment.  
    - Key alignment: Ensure your knees are over your ankles in the lunges, and your hips are squared to the front of the mat in Warrior I. 
    - Modifications: Use blocks for the forward fold if you can't reach the floor. Step instead of jump to transition between poses. 
    - Breath guidance: Inhale as you open or expand, exhale as you fold or contract.

3. Standing Poses: 
    - Balance poses: Vrksasana (Tree Pose), Natarajasana (Dancer's Pose)
    - Strength building: Virabhadrasana I, II, III (Warrior I, II, III)
