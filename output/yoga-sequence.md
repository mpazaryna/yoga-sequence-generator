1. Breath Work (10 minutes)

Start in a comfortable seated position. Begin with basic breath awareness, noticing the natural rhythm of your breath for about a minute.

Then move on to Nadi Shodhana, or alternate nostril breathing. This technique balances the left and right sides of the brain and calms the nervous system. Use your right thumb to close your right nostril and inhale through the left. Close the left nostril with the ring finger, open the right and exhale. Inhale right, close right, open left, exhale. Continue for about 5 minutes.

Next, practice Kapalabhati, or skull shining breath. This technique energizes the body and purifies the respiratory system. Inhale deeply, then exhale forcefully through the nose, pulling the navel toward the spine. The inhale will be automatic. Do three rounds of 30 breaths.

Safety: Do not practice Kapalabhati if you have high blood pressure, heart disease, or a hernia. If you feel dizzy at any point, return to normal breathing.

2. Dynamic Movement (20 minutes)

Start in Mountain Pose. On an inhale, sweep your arms up to the sky. Exhale, bend at the hips and fold forward into Forward Fold. Inhale, lift halfway up to a flat back. Exhale, step or jump back into Plank and lower down into Chaturanga. Inhale into Upward-facing Dog. Exhale into Downward-facing Dog. This is one round of Sun Salutation A. Do five rounds to warm up the body.

Next, practice Sun Salutation B, adding in Warrior I and Chair Pose. Do five rounds.

Then move on to a flowing sequence that includes poses like Crescent Lunge, Warrior II, Side Angle Pose, and Triangle Pose. Try to stay in each pose for five breaths and move on an exhale.

Safety: Always keep the knee in line with the ankle in standing poses to protect the knee joint. 

3. Peak Poses (20 minutes)

Start with Crow Pose, an arm balance that strengthens the upper body and core. From Forward Fold, bend the knees, place the hands on the mat shoulder-width apart, and lift the hips. Come onto the balls of the feet and press the knees into the upper arms while looking forward. Lift one foot off the mat, then the other. 

Next, practice Forearm Stand. From Downward-facing Dog, lower onto the forearms. Walk the feet in closer, lift one leg, and kick up. Use a wall if needed. 

Finally, try Handstand. From Downward-facing Dog, walk the feet in a bit, lift one leg, and kick up. Again, use a wall if needed.

Safety: Warm up the wrists before arm balances and inversions. Come down if you feel any discomfort in the neck. 

4. Integration (10 minutes)

After the peak poses, cool down with counter poses like Child's Pose and Downward-facing Dog. 

Then move on to seated poses like Seated Forward Fold and Seated Twist. 

Finally, lie down for Savasana. Let the body absorb the practice for about 5 minutes. 

Safety: Always end with Savasana to allow the body to integrate the practice.
