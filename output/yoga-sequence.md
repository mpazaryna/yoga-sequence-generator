## Sequence Breakdown

### Opening (5-10 minutes)

We begin with a centering technique of grounding our feet, feeling the earth beneath us. We move into initial breath work, using Ujjayi Pranayama (Victorious Breath) to create heat in the body. We set the intention of balance – finding strength and flexibility in each pose.

### Warm-Up (10-15 minutes)

Our warm-up focuses on loosening the joints and increasing mobility. We will start with neck and shoulder rolls, then move to Cat-Cow Pose (Marjaryasana-Bitilasana) for spinal mobility. We will follow with a gentle stretch in Child's Pose (Balasana), then activate our core with Plank Pose (Phalakasana).

### Main Practice (25-30 minutes)

Our main practice begins with Mountain Pose (Tadasana), focusing on alignment and grounding. We transition into Sun Salutation A (Surya Namaskar A) with key alignment cues for each pose. We will also explore Triangle Pose (Trikonasana) for strength and Side Plank (Vasisthasana) for balance. We will hold each pose for five to ten breaths.

### Cool Down (10-15 minutes)

For our cool down, we will counter our previous poses with Supine Twist (Supta Matsyendrasana) and a gentle hamstring stretch in Reclining Hand-to-Big-Toe Pose (Supta Padangusthasana). We end with Legs-Up-the-Wall Pose (Viparita Karani) for recovery.

### Closing (5-10 minutes)

Our closing will include a final relaxation in Corpse Pose (Savasana), a simple meditation technique focusing on breath awareness, and a brief discussion on integrating the practice off the mat.

## Key Teaching Points

### ALIGNMENT CUES

* In Mountain Pose, root feet down, engage thighs, lift chest.
* In Triangle Pose, align shoulders, engage core, reach fingertips.
* Direct hands-on adjustments to help students find correct alignment.

### BREATHING GUIDANCE

* Inhale to create space, exhale to deepen into poses.
* Coordinate breath with movement, linking each breath to a movement.
* Ujjayi breath to create heat and focus mind.

### MODIFICATIONS

* Yoga blocks for Triangle Pose to bring ground closer.
* Yoga strap for Reclining Hand-to-Big-Toe Pose for tighter hamstrings.
* Knee on the ground for Side Plank for stability.

### SAFETY NOTES

* Avoid deep twists if any spinal injuries.
* Always listen to your body, modify as needed.
* Keep neck neutral in all poses to avoid strain.

### SPIRITUAL ASPECTS

* Yoga is unity – of breath, body, and mind.
* Focus on inner journey, not just physical postures.
* Be present, letting go of external distractions and judgments.

## Common Challenges

* For tight hips, use a block under the sitting bones in seated poses
* For difficulty coordinating breath, return to natural breath and then slowly re-introduce Ujjayi Pranayama
* For balance issues, fix gaze on a non-moving point and engage core
* For disconnect from mental practice, return to intention and breath awareness.
